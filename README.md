# LitFetch: A tool to fetch and sort academic literature

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this tool is to provide federated search functionality and 
basic cleaning and filtering, to automate time consuming tasks.

Current stage of the work: understanding the APIs and how to call them. 

Repo content: work in progress folder with progress to date on API calls (very rough code!).

To call the Springer and ScienceDirect APIs you will need to create an .Renviron
file with your API keys.
