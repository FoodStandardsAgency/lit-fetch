# LitFetch: A tool to fetch and sort academic literature

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this tool is to provide federated search functionality and 
basic cleaning and filtering, to automate time consuming tasks.

Folder `lfshiny` contains the shiny app (under development) 
deployed at https://foodstandards.shinyapps.io/litfetch

Folder `working` contains work in progress on API call functions

Current stage of the work: understanding the APIs and how to call them. 

To call the Springer and ScienceDirect APIs you will need to create an .Renviron
file with your API keys.
